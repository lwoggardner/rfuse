RFuse - DEPRECATED
===============

### DEPRECATED

This gem exists and is maintained for backwards compatibility only.

Existing RFuse filesystems are recommended to refactor to depend directly on
[ffi_libfuse](http://rubygems.org/gems/ffi-libfuse) which supports Fuse 3 and Macfuse

{RFuse::Adapter} documents the fuse method signatures that are different to ffi-libfuse

---------------

### Dependencies

 * Ruby 2.7+
 * Fuse 2.8+ / Fuse 3 / MACFuse

HISTORY
============

This project was forked from rfuse-ng which was forked from the original rfuse.

RFuse-NG: Tamás László Fábián <giganetom@gmail.com> et al on Github

Original Rfuse (@rubyforge): Peter Schrammel AT gmx.de
